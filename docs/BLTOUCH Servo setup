Comment out the line in Configuration.H:
//#define Z_MIN_PROBE_USES_Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_PIN

and define:
#define Z_MIN_PROBE_PIN P0_10

Open Conditionals_LCD.h located in ..Marlin\src\inc.. and change these lines:
#define HAS_CUSTOM_PROBE_PIN DISABLED(Z_MIN_PROBE_USES_Z_MIN_ENDSTOP_PIN)
#define HOMING_Z_WITH_PROBE (Z_HOME_DIR < 0 &&!HAS_CUSTOM_PROBE_PIN)

to:
#define HAS_CUSTOM_PROBE_PIN true
#define HOMING_Z_WITH_PROBE (Z_HOME_DIR < 0)

Basically Marlin doesn't let the printer home the Z-axis with the probe when an end-stop is connected. When I get time, I'll mess around some more and try to add some lines so that the end-stop can be used as a fail-safe in case of probe failure (which is probably the original code's intent).

My BLTouch is fully functional and tested with this method. Just keep an eye on it because I'm not sure if the end-stop will do anything if the probe doesn't home properly.
